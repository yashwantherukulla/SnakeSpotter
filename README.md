# 🐍 Snake vs Background Image Classifier

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project was initiated to support wildlife conservation efforts in snake-rich ecosystems. By accurately distinguishing between snake images and background images, we aim to assist researchers and field workers in cataloging snake populations and understanding their habitats. This tool could potentially be integrated into mobile applications for quick snake identification, enhancing both research capabilities and safety measures for people working in or visiting snake-inhabited areas.

## 🔬 Project Overview
This project implements a binary classifier to distinguish between snake images and background images using a VGG16 model with a modified head. The classifier is built using PyTorch and is designed to be a learning exercise for participants interested in deep learning and computer vision.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of images divided into two classes:
1. Snake images
2. Background images (non-snake images)

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The main components of the project are:
1. Data preparation and loading
2. Model architecture (VGG16 with custom classifier)
3. Training and validation loops
4. Evaluation metrics and visualization

## 🛠️ Setup and Dependencies
The project requires the following main libraries:
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- pandas
Additional dependencies are listed in the import statements at the beginning of the script.

## 🚂 Training
The model is trained for 15 epochs using SGD optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss. The training process includes both training and validation steps, with results logged for each epoch.

## 📊 Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set. Evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
Additionally, a confusion matrix and classification report are generated and visualized.

## 👁️ Visualization
The project includes functions to visualize:
- Sample images from the dataset
- Training and validation loss/accuracy curves
- Predictions on individual images
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## 🏋️ Pre-trained Weights Option
An option for loading Pre-trained weights is available and can be loaded using the `load_with_pretrained_weights` function.

## 🧠 Challenges for Participants
This project contains several issues that participants are challenged to identify and fix. These issues range from data preprocessing to model architecture and training process. Participants should carefully review the code, run it, and improve its performance. By working on these challenges, you'll also enhance your machine learning skills on the way.😄


Good luck, and happy coding! 🚀🐍
